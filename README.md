# Movie-Watch-Pattern-Clustering-Project-AI
This project focuses on clustering users based on their movie-watching behavior using unsupervised machine learning. The dataset includes features like watch time, genre preferences, and average movie ratings. By applying KMeans clustering and PCA-based visualization, the project uncovers user segments with similar viewing patterns. These insights can be used for building personalized recommendation systems and understanding audience behavior. This project analyzes movie-watching behavior by clustering users into distinct groups based on:

Time of watching (hour of the day)

Genre preference (action, comedy, drama, thriller)

Rating patterns (average ratings given)
